Hi, 

These files are from the recent Node-Red videos found on our YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/@BoatingwiththeBaileys

The digital switching files are from this video https://youtu.be/NCSkvaSZDD4?si=LGSn0JMK0Q8Gps4Y and give you the Node-Red configuration I used to demo digital switching & LED lighting control.

The live tracking and menu file is from this video https://youtu.be/NiyvFujwrKI and will build a menu so you can ask your boat for some data.

Any questions, comments or improvements, please let us us know.

Thanks,
The Baileys.
